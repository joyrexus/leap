We're using this repo to develop custom rendering tools ("viewers") for the gesture samples we're capturing with the [Leap](http://leapmotion.com) motion sensor.  These viewers are designed to help us analyze particular aspects of the captured gesture sample.

Our initial viewer is deployed [here](http://joyrexus.github.io/sandbox/leap/viewer/).

The samples were captured with [handy](https://github.com/joyrexus/handy), a little command-line tool that enables you to capture a gesture sample (with optional audio) and generate a web page with the sample embedded.

See our [notes](https://github.com/joyrexus/notes/blob/master/leap/index.md)    for an overview of the device, links to related projects, and useful            development references.
